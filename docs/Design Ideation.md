During class, our team used Microsoft Whiteboard to brainstorm ideas using sticky notes, ultimately generating around 100 unique concepts. The goal of this session was to propose any features or requirements that could support our user needs without limiting creativity. Once all ideas were collected, we organized them into three main categories to better understand our design direction. These categories included sensing capabilities, structural and build features, and potential power solutions for the device.

## <h2 style="color:#E91E63; font-weight:700;">Background Information</h2>
Our team used a structured decision-making process to select the final design concept. We began by generating a wide range of ideas through group ideation sessions, focusing on sensing capabilities, and environmental durability. During this phase, we identified several strong concepts like multi-sensor weather monitoring, wireless alerts, autonomous operation, and long-term data collection. Instead of choosing only one concept, we combined the strongest features into a single integrated solution. We compared ideas based on feasibility, cost, power requirements, and alignment with our mission of wildfire prevention. Through discussion and voting, we selected the concept that offered the best balance of practicality and impact: a deployable, weather-resistant wildfire-monitoring station that collects environmental data and provides early warning through wireless communication.

Our final design aligns closely with the ideas on the sticky notes during ideation. While early sketches included more complex features like drones, motors, and advanced thermal imaging. We streamlined the design to emphasize core sensors, reliability, and ease of deployment.

The concept sketch satisfies the needs of wildfire prevention in many ways. There are multiple sensors included to detect smoke and measure the intensity of heat. The smoke detector is positioned on the top of the fire-monitoring station so it can properly measure smoke levels if a wildfire begins. All other sensors are enclosed inside a protective box that is designed to withstand harsh weather conditions. This enclosure also helps keep animals from interfering with the device. A cage will be added on top to provide additional protection. Vents will be placed along the sides to reduce moisture buildup and maintain airflow. The station will be mounted close to the ground so it can gather more accurate smoke readings during a wildfire event.

## <h2 style="color:#E91E63; font-weight:700;">Functionality</h2>

There were initially 4 planned areas of functionality in our design:


1. Sensing - Daniel Resnick & Sophie Bryant
2. Acuator - Luke Jeffs
3. Communication - Cut due to changes to the team
4. Microcontroller -Tyler Dean

Given the loss of a group member early on after our ideation phase, we were able to keep moving without major impediment, but cut out the Communication area as a major subsystem.

## <h2 style="color:#E91E63; font-weight:700;">Design Evolution</h2>

Our design was created with a large focus on simplicity from the beginning in order to allow us to focus on creating something robust and cost effective. The LEDs used were always intended to be an indicator for when a threshold deemed dangerous was passed, and this can function with any included sensors, as long as the sensors are given a predetermined value that when passed, alerts the device to issue a warning to those nearby, and record that the value was in fact exceeded.
