## Team Roles
| Name | Team Role | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| Sophie Bryant | Team Lead & Coordinator | Oversees deadlines, communication, and ensures tasks align with goals |
| Tyler Dean | Technical & Implementation Lead | Focuses on coding, circuitry, or building |
| Luke Jeffs |  Testing & Quality Lead | Handles troubleshooting, debugging, and verifying requirements |
| Daniel Resnick | Design & Research Lead | Handles brainstorming, user needs, diagrams, and documentation |

During class time we came up with ideas on sticky notes in Microsoft Whiteboard. We came up with a total of 100 sticky notes. The objective of this brainstorming session was to come up with any features or requirements that fit our user needs. After generating all of these ideas we grouped them into 3 categories. The categories were sensing, build features, and how the design would be powered.

## Background information
Our team used a structured decision-making process to select the final design concept. We began by generating a wide range of ideas through group ideation sessions, focusing on sensing capabilities, and environmental durability. During this phase, we identified several strong concepts like multi-sensor weather monitoring, wireless alerts, autonomous operation, and long-term data collection. Instead of choosing only one concept, we combined the strongest features into a single integrated solution. We compared ideas based on feasibility, cost, power requirements, and alignment with our mission of wildfire prevention. Through discussion and voting, we selected the concept that offered the best balance of practicality and impact: a deployable, weather-resistant wildfire-monitoring station that collects environmental data and provides early warning through wireless communication.

Our final design aligns closely with the ideas on the sticky notes during ideation. While early sketches included more complex features like drones, motors, and advanced thermal imaging. We streamlined the design to emphasize core sensors, reliability, and ease of deployment.


## Concept Sketch

The concept sketch satisfies the needs of wildfire prevention in many ways. There are multiple sensors included to detect smoke and measure the intensity of heat. The smoke detector is positioned on the top of the fire-monitoring station so it can properly measure smoke levels if a wildfire begins. All other sensors are enclosed inside a protective box that is designed to withstand harsh weather conditions. This enclosure also helps keep animals from interfering with the device. A cage will be added on top to provide additional protection. Vents will be placed along the sides to reduce moisture buildup and maintain airflow. The station will be mounted close to the ground so it can gather more accurate smoke readings during a wildfire event.

## Functionality

There will be 4 main areas of functionlity split across each member of the team.


1. Sensing
2. Acuator
3. Communication
4. Microcontroller

In this early stage we have not picked our components yet or decided who on the team is designing each area. Durability is huge with our proposed design because it will be outside and exposed to the elements.
