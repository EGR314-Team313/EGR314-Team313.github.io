## Team Roles
Sophie Bryant - Team Lead / Coordinator – Oversees deadlines, communication, and ensures tasks align with goals. 
Tyler Dean -  Technical/Implementation Lead – Focuses on coding, circuitry, or building.
Luke Jeffs -  Testing/Quality Lead – Handles troubleshooting, debugging, and verifying requirements.
Daniel Resnick - Design/Research Lead – Handles brainstorming, user needs, diagrams, and documentation.

During class time we came up with ideas on sticky notes in Microsoft Whiteboard. We came up with a total of 100 sticky notes. The objective of this brainstorming session was to come up with any features or requirements that fit our user needs. After generating all of these ideas we grouped them into 3 categories. The categories were sensing, build features, and how the design would be powered.

## Background information

In recent history wildfires have increased in quantity and intensity. These fires happen in remote uninhabited locations far from society. Due to their hard to reach location these fires can quickly become unmanageable if left un attended. Our group wants to create a device to aid in the prevention of these wildfires. Our idea is to create a network of weather stations that can be deployed into remote areas to detect wildfires in their early more manageable stages. These devices will be able to collect and store data on weather conditions like temperature, humidity, wind, and smoke. This will allow the device to act as an early warning system and collect weather data to better understand conditions leading up to wildfires.

Our device will be marketed toward organizations that deal with wildfires as well as remote communities in wildfire hot spots. Our team attended a presentation with Mike Borszich who is a manager with the State of Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management. We learned how drones are being used to monitor wildfires that have already been detected. When asking we learned there is not much information on how to predict where wildfires will happen before the start. Our device will be able to help gather information to understand precursors to wildfires better. We will also be able to help remote communities have an early warning system on potential wildfire dangers. These two groups will be our main stakeholders.
