## Team Roles

During class time we came upi with ideas on sticky notes in Microsoft Whiteboard. We came up with a total of 100 sticky notes. The objective of this brainstorming session was to come up with any features or requirements that fit our user needs. After generating all of these ideas we grouped them into 3 categories. The categories were sensing, build features, and how powered.
