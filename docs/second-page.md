##Team Charter
Our team will work together throughout the semester to complete a project involving wildfire prevention. We will combine our established knowledge with future learnings to create a device our stakeholders will be interested in. Our team has chosen to communicate through discord with text messaging being our backup form of communication. We will in the future assign roles for members such as meeting leader, assignment leader, meeting recorder, and project monitor. These roles will help organize the group and hold people accountable for their work. We hope to fully understand how using surface mount devices can effect the design process. We also want understand how to best work together professionally.
##Team Mission Statement 
Our team will design from concept to working prototype an embedded system device related to wildfire prevention and deterrence. While working through our beginning brainstorming our team decided we would like to build a ground level weather station. The main idea for this project is to collect and store relevant weather data like temperature, humidity, and wind. This device would be a warning system as well as a data collection device. When one of our stakeholders came to class to discuss the current state of wildfire prevention he mentioned that most of their work is in response to wildfires. We would like to help gather data on weather conditions prior to the start of wildfire to better predict them before they start in the future.
