## Team Charter
We aim to develop and explore the resources and skills available to us in order to develop our design and document the process in a professional format. While fulfilling course requirements, we also seek the opportunity to propose a reasonable tool to aid in the prevention of forest fires. By the end of the semester, we plan to have a baseline design that could be retrofitted to different areas, climates, or conditions.
## Team Mission Statement 
Our team will design from concept to working prototype an embedded system device related to wildfire prevention and deterrence by collecting weather data and being an early alarm system. Our work will help firefighting organizations and remote communities in wildfire prevention and deterrence.

## User Needs
We wanted to create a compact, reliable, and easy-to-operate device that can accurately measure environmental conditions. That will include temperature, pressure, and other key indicators, while also providing clear visual feedback and optional wireless communication. The system must be simple to power, durable, and capable of functioning consistently in various indoor or outdoor environments. We also wanted a design that is intuitive to understand, safe to handle, and able to deliver real-time information without requiring technical expertise or specialized tools.

## Problem Statement
Current low cost sensing solutions often lack accuracy, real-time feedback, or the ability to integrate multiple environmental measurements in a single platform. These limitations make it difficult for users to monitor changing conditions or receive immediate indicators when thresholds are exceeded. We needed to develop a compact, battery-powered system that reliably gathers temperature and pressure data, processes the information through a microcontroller, and communicates results visually and wirelessly as needed. The solution must be accurate, efficient, and easy to use while meeting the technical constraints of power, size, and manufacturability.
