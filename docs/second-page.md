## Team Charter
We aim to develop and explore the resources and skills available to us in order to develop our design and document the process in a professional format. While fulfilling course requirements, we also seek the opportunity to propose a reasonable tool to aid in the prevention of forest fires. By the end of the semester, we plan to have a baseline design that could be retrofitted to different areas, climates, or conditions.
## Team Mission Statement 
Our team will design from concept to working prototype an embedded system device related to wildfire prevention and deterrence by collecting weather data and being an early alarm system. Our work will help firefighting organizations and remote communities in wildfire prevention and deterrence.
