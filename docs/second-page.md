## Team Charter
Our team is committed to applying our collective skills and the engineering resources available to us to develop a well-documented, functional prototype focused on wildfire prevention. Throughout the semester, we will collaborate effectively, communicate openly, and uphold professional standards in all stages of design, testing, and documentation. In addition to meeting course requirements, we aim to create a scalable and adaptable baseline system that can be modified for use in various regions, climates, and environmental conditions. Our charter centers on teamwork, innovation, and the shared goal of contributing to technologies that reduce wildfire risks and support community safety.
## Team Mission Statement 
Our mission is to design and build a working embedded system that collects critical environmental data and provides early-warning indicators to support wildfire prevention efforts. By integrating reliable sensors, robust power management, and wireless communication, our device will serve as a proactive alert tool for firefighters, land managers, and remote communities. Through engineering rigor and thoughtful design, we strive to create a prototype that demonstrates both practical function and potential real-world impact in reducing wildfire threats.

## User Needs
We wanted to create a compact, reliable, and easy-to-operate device that can accurately measure environmental conditions. That will include temperature, pressure, and other key indicators, while also providing clear visual feedback and optional wireless communication. The system must be simple to power, durable, and capable of functioning consistently in various indoor or outdoor environments. We also wanted a design that is intuitive to understand, safe to handle, and able to deliver real-time information without requiring technical expertise or specialized tools.

## Problem Statement
Current low cost sensing solutions often lack accuracy, real-time feedback, or the ability to integrate multiple environmental measurements in a single platform. These limitations make it difficult for users to monitor changing conditions or receive immediate indicators when thresholds are exceeded. We needed to develop a compact, battery-powered system that reliably gathers temperature and pressure data, processes the information through a microcontroller, and communicates results visually and wirelessly as needed. The solution must be accurate, efficient, and easy to use while meeting the technical constraints of power, size, and manufacturability.
