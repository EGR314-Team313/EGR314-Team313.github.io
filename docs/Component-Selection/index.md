**Choice:** Option 1, 74HC595PW-Q100,118

**Rationale:** This choice has a significant number in stock at a low price, a very clear datasheet, and a comes in a package I can reliably solder with confidence. Many can be purchased for testing and the simplicity allows for the initial goals to be reached and further development to be explored.

**Choice:**  
Solution 2 - BME280

**Rationale:**  
The BME280 sensor is the best choice because it can measure differenet types of data. Additonaly, it outputs compensated data directly so there is no need for complex math. Also it has a low power draw and lots of community suport. It is accurate and sufficient for altitute tracking.
