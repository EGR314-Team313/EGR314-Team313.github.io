# Team Charter Appendix A 

Team Goals for Development

## Data Collection & Transmission
- [ ] Ensure the weather station can **consistently send real-time data** to a central server/cloud.  
- [ ] Implement **redundant communication methods** (e.g., LoRa, Wi-Fi, LTE) for reliability in remote areas.  
- [ ] Include **local data logging** (SD card or onboard memory) in case of communication failure.  

## Environmental Monitoring
- [ ] Measure **temperature** (ambient + heat spikes).  
- [ ] Record **humidity** and **wind speed/direction** for fire spread prediction.  
- [ ] Detect **air quality indicators** such as smoke and particulates (PM2.5, PM10).  

## Fire Detection & Prevention
- [ ] Trigger **alerts** when abnormal heat or smoke is detected.  
- [ ] Establish **threshold levels** for different risk stages (warning, alert, emergency).  
- [ ] Support **automated early warning systems** (e.g., SMS/email/IoT alerts).  

## Power & Reliability
- [ ] Design a **solar + battery backup system** for continuous operation.  
- [ ] Implement **low-power modes** to conserve energy when idle.  
- [ ] Ensure **rugged, weatherproof housing** for harsh outdoor environments.  

## Collaboration & Documentation
- [ ] Maintain clear **GitHub repository** for source code, schematics, and documentation.
