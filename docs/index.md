Our project focuses on creating a network of remote weather-monitoring devices to help prevent wildfires. These stations will collect key environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind, and smoke levels. The goal is to detect early signs of wildfire ignition before the situation becomes unmanageable. Each device will also store local weather information to help researchers better understand the conditions that lead to wildfire outbreaks. Our system is designed for organizations involved in wildfire management and for remote communities in high-risk areas. By providing early warnings and valuable environmental data, our device aims to improve safety, response time, and overall wildfire prevention efforts.
