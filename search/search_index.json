This ensured that the diagram reflected how the system will actually function on the PCB, including I\u00b2C connections for the sensors, SPI for the shift register, and the regulated 3.3 V power path from the 9 V supply. The final diagram meets our product requirements by clearly showing how the microcontroller collects data from the BME280 and LM92 sensors, communicates wirelessly using ESP-NOW, drives visual indicators through the shift register and LEDs, and receives stable power from the regulator.

Shift Register 74HC595PW-Q100,118 Large stock availability, low cost, clear documentation, and comes in a package that is easy and reliable to solder. Supports simple testing and future expansion. Environmental Sensor (Temp/Pressure/Humidity) BME280 Measures multiple parameters, outputs compensated data (reduces math/processing), low power consumption, strong community support, and good accuracy for altitude tracking. Voltage Regulator LM2575D2T-3.3R4G Familiar, previously used in class, fixed 3.3 V output suitable for all components, supports up to 1 A, and offers reliable surface-mount implementation. Microcontroller ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 Built-in antenna simplifies wireless subsystem, enables communication backup features, good performance, and requires only a PCB keep-out zone for proper RF operation. <p>Our decision-making process for this section focused on aligning each component with the product\u2019s functional requirements, constraints, and long-term reliability. We compared multiple options for every subsystem by examining accuracy, power consumption, availability, solderability, cost, and ease of PCB integration. Components that introduced unnecessary complexity, increased design risk, or did not fit the power and communication architecture were eliminated early. The final selections represent the options that delivered the best balance of performance, manufacturability, and system compatibility while still supporting future scalability and testing.</p> <p>Each chosen component directly meets or exceeds the needs of the product. The temperature sensor (LM92CMX) provides the highest accuracy and the easiest solder-joint configuration, ensuring dependable thermal readings. The 74HC595PW-Q100,118 shift register fulfills the requirement for expanded digital outputs at a low cost with minimal design overhead. The BME280 offers reliable multi-parameter environmental data with compensated outputs, reducing the need for complex math while enabling altitude and climate tracking. The LM2575D2T-3.3R4G regulator provides a stable 3.3 V supply and sufficient current capacity for all subsystems, supported by prior familiarity that reduces layout errors.
