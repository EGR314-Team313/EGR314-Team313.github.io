From there we placed the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 at the center because it is responsible for all decisions, data processing, and wireless communication. The 9 V battery and LM2575D2T-3.3R4G regulator were placed on the left as the single power path so it is clear that every other block ultimately depends on a regulated 3.3 V rail. The BME280 pressure/temperature/humidity sensor and LM92 temperature sensor are shown on I\u00b2C links into the ESP32 to emphasize that all environmental data flows through a common digital bus. On the right, the 74HC595PW shift register and LED block are connected by SPI / digital-parallel lines to show how the microcontroller expands its outputs to drive multiple visual indicators. Finally, the ESP-NOW cloud in the center-top shows that the same ESP32 both transmits and receives data, tying the remote node into a wider network of wildfire-monitoring stations. This structure directly reflects the product requirements: stable off-grid power, multi-sensor environmental monitoring, wireless early-warning communication, and clear visual feedback for local users.</p>"},{"location":"Block-Diagram/#functionality-of-communication-sequence-diagram","title":"Functionality of Communication Sequence Diagram","text":"<p> In the communication sequence diagram, we model the interactions between the remote sensor node, the ESP-NOW network, and a base or gateway node. The sequence begins with the remote node waking from sleep, sampling the BME280 and LM92, and performing local checks such as threshold comparisons and sanity checks on sensor values. It then packages the readings with metadata and sends a compact ESP-NOW message to the gateway. The gateway acknowledges reception and logs the data, then optionally forwards alerts or summaries to firefighters or remote communities. If an acknowledgment is not received, the remote node retries transmission with a bounded number of attempts before returning to low-power sleep. This sequence satisfies user needs by ensuring timely delivery of weather and smoke-related data, robustness to packet loss, and low-power operation so the device can remain deployed in remote locations. It also meets product requirements for early warning because threshold checks and alert messages are integrated directly into the communication flow, not treated as an afterthought.</p>"},{"location":"Block-Diagram/#design-and-desicion-making-process","title":"Design and Desicion Making Process","text":"<p> Our team started with a simple idea of \u201cjust sending sensor values,\u201d then iterated as we mapped requirements from the user-needs analysis. We decided each message must contain at least: a node ID, a timestamp or sequence number, the sensor readings (temperature, pressure, humidity, smoke / heat indicators), and health information such as battery level and internal error flags. Early on we discussed sending JSON strings for readability, but we realized this would increase packet size, airtime, and power consumption. We therefore switched to a fixed-length binary structure with predefined byte offsets for each field. This choice makes parsing faster and more deterministic on both the remote node and gateway. We also added a small checksum or CRC field to detect corrupted messages, which is important in wildfire environments with possible interference. Overall, the message structure is a compromise between clarity, robustness, and efficiency, and it directly supports the functions depicted in our communication sequence diagram.</p>"},{"location":"Block-Diagram/#top-5-biggest-changes-to-the-software-design","title":"Top 5 Biggest Changes to the Software Design","text":""},{"location":"Board-Design/","title":"Schematic and PCB","text":""},{"location":"Board-Design/#team-schematic","title":"Team Schematic","text":"<p>Team313_Schematic.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Board-Design/#pcb-front","title":"PCB Front","text":""},{"location":"Board-Design/#pcb-back","title":"PCB Back","text":""},{"location":"Board-Design/#functionality","title":"Functionality","text":"<p>The functionality of this schematic meets our user needs and product requirements by ensuring that every subsystem works together to collect reliable environmental data. The voltage regulator provides a stable 3.3-volt supply, which keeps all components powered safely and prevents system resets during outdoor temperature swings. The ESP32 microcontroller serves as the core of the device and manages all communication, allowing sensors to report data consistently. The pressure sensor and temperature sensor each connect through properly designed signal paths, enabling accurate measurements of weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric changes. The shift register and LEDs provide visual indicators, giving users quick feedback during testing and deployment. Test points and jumpers make the device easier to debug, repair, and maintain.

We began by reviewing the product requirements and identifying the essential functions that the schematic needed to provide. This included stable power regulation, accurate sensing, reliable communication, and clear visual outputs. We compared several circuit layouts and refined the design by selecting components that were available, easy to integrate, and compatible with our 3.3 V system. We also made deliberate choices about sensor placement, power routing, and signal paths to reduce noise and improve accuracy. Throughout the process we revisited our requirements, prototype feedback, and class recommendations to make sure the final schematic remained practical, manufacturable, and aligned with the needs of users and stakeholders. This helped us create a circuit that is simple, stable, and capable of supporting our wildfire-monitoring device over long periods of deployment.</p>"},{"location":"Board-Design/#verision-20","title":"Verision 2.0","text":"<p>If we were to create a Version 2.0 of our hardware design, several improvements would be made to increase reliability, simplify assembly, and support long-term field use. One of the first upgrades would be strengthening the power subsystem. Although the current regulator and 3.3 V rail meet the needs of the device, Version 2.0 would incorporate additional filtering capacitors, reverse-polarity protection, and a TVS diode to protect against voltage spikes. These changes would make the system more resilient, especially in remote outdoor environments where power fluctuations and harsh conditions are more common. The schematic would also benefit from adding test points for all major voltage rails and communication lines. This would significantly improve debuggability, especially during field maintenance and prototype testing. Test points would give us rapid access to I\u00b2C, ESP-NOW power rails, the shift register outputs, and the regulator input and output lines. This would reduce troubleshooting time and make diagnostics more systematic.</p> <p>Another improvement for Version 2.0 would be updating sensor placement and protection. The BME280 and LM92 sensors already fulfill accuracy requirements, but the next version would place them on modular daughterboards. This would allow easier replacement, calibration, and environmental shielding. A removable sensor module would improve long-term maintenance and give communities the ability to upgrade sensors without replacing the entire device. We would also add more robust environmental shielding such as conformal coating, gasketed vents, and mesh protection around the smoke-detection components. These additions would increase durability in areas exposed to wind, dust, moisture, and wildfire particles. The schematic supports this by separating sensor pins cleanly, meaning that adding connectors and headers in Version 2.0 would be straightforward.</p> <p>Version 2.0 would also improve communication and expandability. The ESP32 could be paired with an external PCB antenna or SMA connector to increase range in remote areas. The current design relies on the onboard antenna and a simple keep-out zone. The improved version would give us stronger, more reliable links between weather-station nodes. The shift-register system would also be updated to include pull-down resistors, better decoupling, and optional output-enable control. This would allow safer startup behavior and reduce noise on long cable runs. Additional onboard LEDs for debugging would also be added. These LEDs would clearly indicate power status, communication activity, sensor faults, and memory status. This would make field testing dramatically easier.</p> <p>Overall, Version 2.0 would make the hardware more rugged, modular, maintainable, and scalable. The schematic already provides a strong baseline for these changes, because the power rails, communication lines, and sensor interfaces are clearly separated. By refining power protection, sensor modularity, communication features, and debugging capability, the next generation of this device would be more reliable, easier to service, and better suited for long-term wildfire-prevention deployment. These improvements would support stronger data accuracy, greater system uptime, and higher confidence for the organizations and communities relying on the device.</p>"},{"location":"Design%20Ideation/","title":"Design Ideation","text":""},{"location":"Design%20Ideation/#team-roles","title":"Design Ideation","text":"Team Roles Name Team Role Description Sophie Bryant Team Lead &amp; Coordinator Oversees deadlines, communication, and ensures tasks align with goals Tyler Dean Technical &amp; Implementation Lead Focuses on coding, circuitry, or building Luke Jeffs Testing &amp; Quality Lead Handles troubleshooting, debugging, and verifying requirements Daniel Resnick Design &amp; Research Lead Handles brainstorming, user needs, diagrams, and documentation <p>During class, our team used Microsoft Whiteboard to brainstorm ideas using sticky notes, ultimately generating around 100 unique concepts.

Instead of choosing only one concept, we combined the strongest features into a single integrated solution. We compared ideas based on feasibility, cost, power requirements, and alignment with our mission of wildfire prevention.

Manage your time intentionally by breaking the project into weekly goals, since waiting until the last minute quickly leads to burnout and prevents the team from completing a functional prototype.  </p>  ##   If we were to develop a Version 2.0 of our communication architecture, several improvements could be made to increase reliability, expand functionality, and make the system easier to debug and maintain. Our current design uses ESP-NOW to send sensor data between devices, which works well for short-range broadcasts but has limitations when scaling, logging, or integrating with external systems. In a Version 2.0 system, we would move toward a more structured and modular communication architecture that supports multiple message types, error detection, and long-term data handling. This would allow our weather-station network to operate more reliably in remote wildfire-prone areas where consistent communication and robustness are essential. One of the first improvements would be implementing a more organized message structure. Currently, our messages send raw sensor data in a simple format. A Version 2.0 system would incorporate message headers, device IDs, timestamps, and CRC checksums for error detection. This makes the architecture more scalable and easier to decode, especially if many devices broadcast simultaneously. We would also divide our software into clearer modules\u2014such as sensing, message formatting, transmission, reception, and data handling\u2014so that each subsystem operates independently. This modularity would support easier debugging and allow individual components to be upgraded without affecting the entire system. Improving debuggability would be a high priority. Version 2.0 would include serial logging, an internal testing mode, and LED indicators tied to communication status (successful send, failure, pairing issues). These additions would help quickly identify communication faults in the field. Additionally, we could implement a communication watchdog timer to reset the wireless subsystem if data is not transmitted or received within a specified window. Features like these increase the system\u2019s robustness and reduce the chance of undetected failures during a wildfire event. We would also expand the communication protocol to support new functions such as acknowledgments (ACKs), retransmission on failure, and possibly queued data packets for situations where communication temporarily drops. For long-term improvements, Version 2.0 could integrate LoRa or cellular IoT as an optional long-range communication method. In remote wildfire environments, ESP-NOW may not cover the required distance between station nodes, and long-range communication could significantly improve system reliability. Version 2.0 would include better system-level organization. We would separate sensor polling intervals from communication intervals so that the device does not waste energy transmitting too often. We would also expand protocol support to include versioning\u2014ensuring that future sensors or nodes remain compatible with older units. Through these improvements, Version 2.0 of our communication architecture would become more stable, reliable, and scalable, ultimately enabling a more effective wildfire-prevention early-warning network."},{"location":"Resources/","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"Resources/#team-image","title":"Team Image","text":""},{"location":"apendix/","title":"Apendix","text":""},{"location":"apendix/#team-charter-appendix-a","title":"Team Charter Appendix A","text":"<p>Team Goals for Development</p>"},{"location":"apendix/#data-collection-transmission","title":"Data Collection &amp; Transmission","text":"<ul> <li> Ensure the weather station can consistently send real-time data to a central server/cloud.</li> <li> Implement redundant communication methods (e.g., LoRa, Wi-Fi, LTE) for reliability in remote areas.</li> <li> Include local data logging (SD card or onboard memory) in case of communication failure.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"apendix/#environmental-monitoring","title":"Environmental Monitoring","text":"<ul> <li> Measure temperature (ambient + heat spikes).</li> <li> Record humidity and wind speed/direction for fire spread prediction.</li> <li> Detect air quality indicators such as smoke and particulates (PM2.5, PM10).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"apendix/#fire-detection-prevention","title":"Fire Detection &amp; Prevention","text":"<ul> <li> Trigger alerts when abnormal heat or smoke is detected.</li> <li> Establish threshold levels for different risk stages (warning, alert, emergency).</li> <li> Support automated early warning systems (e.g., SMS/email/IoT alerts).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"apendix/#power-reliability","title":"Power &amp; Reliability","text":"<ul> <li> Design a solar + battery backup system for continuous operation.</li> <li> Implement low-power modes to conserve energy when idle.</li> <li> Ensure rugged, weatherproof housing for harsh outdoor environments.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"apendix/#collaboration-documentation","title":"Collaboration &amp; Documentation","text":"<ul> <li> Maintain clear GitHub repository for source code, schematics, and documentation.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"apendix/#team-communications","title":"Team Communications","text":"Name First Choice Communication Second Choice Communication Third Choice Communication Luke Jeffs Discord Phone Email Daniel Resnick Discord Phone Email Sophie Bryant Discord Phone Email Tyler Dean Discord Phone Email"},{"location":"apendix/#roles-responsibilities","title":"Roles &amp; Responsibilities","text":"Role Duties Meeting leader-Sophie Bryant Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting Meeting recorder-Luke Jeffs Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned Assignment leader-Tyler Dean Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date Assignment coordinator-Dan Resnick Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status"},{"location":"apendix/#design-ideation-appendix-a","title":"Design Ideation Appendix A","text":""},{"location":"apendix/#unsorted-list","title":"Unsorted list","text":""},{"location":"apendix/#groups","title":"Groups","text":""},{"location":"apendix/#grouped-and-ranked","title":"Grouped and Ranked","text":""},{"location":"pic-table/","title":"PIC Table","text":"ESP Info Answer Help Model ?

The final selections represent the options that delivered the best balance of performance, manufacturability, and system compatibility while still supporting future scalability and testing.</p> <p>Each chosen component directly meets or exceeds the needs of the product. The temperature sensor (LM92CMX) provides the highest accuracy and the easiest solder-joint configuration, ensuring dependable thermal readings. The 74HC595PW-Q100,118 shift register fulfills the requirement for expanded digital outputs at a low cost with minimal design overhead. The BME280 offers reliable multi-parameter environmental data with compensated outputs, reducing the need for complex math while enabling altitude and climate tracking. The LM2575D2T-3.3R4G regulator provides a stable 3.3 V supply and sufficient current capacity for all subsystems, supported by prior familiarity that reduces layout errors. Lastly, the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 meets the processing and wireless communication requirements with its integrated antenna and strong community support. These components ensure the final product is accurate, efficient, manufacturable, and aligned with all defined system requirements.</p>"},{"location":"Component-Selection/#bill-of-materials","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"<p>Team 313 Bill of Materials.xlsx - Sheet1.pdf</p> <p>We used the power budget to estimate our system\u2019s total current draw by listing every active component, pulling its maximum current from the datasheet, and multiplying it by the quantity shown in the BOM. By assuming worst-case conditions, ESP32 transmitting, all sensors active, and all LEDs on. We created a conservative estimate rather than relying on typical values. After summing all currents and adding design margin, we compared the total to the LM2575D2T-3.3R4G regulator\u2019s 1 A limit.</p> <p>The analysis showed that our system remains well below the regulator\u2019s maximum output, meaning the 3.3 V rail is stable, safe, and capable of supporting all components without risk of brownout. This confirms that our chosen regulator and input supply provide enough headroom for reliable operation and small future expansions.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#mathjax","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#beautiful-math-in-all-browsers","title":"Beautiful math in all browsers","text":"<p>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.
