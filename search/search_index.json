THere are multiple sensors to detect smoke and the instensity of heat. The smoke detector is attacehd to the top of the fire monitiring station to ensure that it can measure levels properly if there is a fire. All other sensors are enclosed in a box that is meant to withstand the elements. It is also enclosed to keep out animals. There will be a cage on the top to also asssit with this. Vents will be added on the side to keep out moisture. The box will be on the ground to get a more accurate reading of smoke if there is a wildfire. </p>"},{"location":"Design%20Ideation/#functionality","title":"Functionality","text":"<p>There will be 4 main areas of functionlity split across each member of the team. 1.
